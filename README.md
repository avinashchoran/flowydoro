## What is the Flowmodoro Method?

The **Flowmodoro technique** is a flexible time management method that helps maximize productivity by encouraging a state of "flow". Unlike the traditional Pomodoro Technique with its rigid 25-minute work intervals and 5-minute breaks, Flowmodoro allows for more customizable and natural work periods. You work for as long as you can maintain focus, and then take a break when you feel you need one. This makes it particularly effective for creative tasks where interruptions can be disruptive. The break time in the Flowmodoro method is often calculated based on the duration of the focus session, for example, by dividing the focus time by five.
